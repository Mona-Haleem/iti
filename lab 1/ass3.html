				My dog is my best friend. She likes to chase the soccer ball when I practice. It is 				so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. 				It just won't fit!

				Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old, I started to go into the 				street to get a ball that had rolled across the street. Of course Idid not think to 				look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwords onto the sidewalk. I 				was mad until I saw the car go by where I would have been. Then I was so happy that 				Sasha was smarter than I was.
